# Netflix EDA Project ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“ˆ

This project is my **second end-to-end practice project** after Titanic dataset.  
The aim was to simulate a **real-world data analyst task** by cleaning, analyzing, and extracting insights from Netflixâ€™s catalog dataset.

## ðŸš€ What I Did
- Imported and cleaned the dataset (handled missing values, standardized strings).
- Explored **basic stats** (counts, unique values, first/last years).
- Applied **groupby, value_counts, and sorting** for deeper insights.
- Built **pivot tables** to summarize content trends by country, type, and year.
- Worked with **dates** to analyze seasonal/monthly release patterns.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas, Numpy**  

## ðŸ“Š Example Insights
- **USA and India** produce the highest number of Netflix titles.  
- Most content is classified under **TV-MA** and **TV-14**, showing Netflixâ€™s focus on teen/adult audiences.  
- The **earliest title** is from the 1920s, while new content continues to grow rapidly.  
- **July and December** see peaks in new content added.  

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Visualize findings using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**.  
- Combine external datasets (e.g., IMDB ratings) for deeper analysis.
